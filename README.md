Overview

The sentiment and rumblings of Crypto Twitter are ultimately the best news source for the Ethereum space at the moment; people who are not on Twitter, or who are not following the right people, have absolutely no exposure to this data. An incredible amount is happening in Ethereum daily, and, in addition to this being hard to track due to the ever-increasing amount of activity, it might even seem like there is NO activity to those who are not a part of the Crypto Twitter echo chamber. However, this project can help rectify both of these problems and can help expose the rest of the world to all of the amazing activity happening on Ethereum.
This project aims to design a tweet library for Ethereum top profiles and the entire community, the library provides an easy way for individuals to ensure not to miss important tweets, community-wide announcements, project-wide announcements, Ethereum-specific conferences, community giveaways bounty, Layer2 and jobs.

Project Name:   Ethereum Tweet Library
